## General

This is a package created for the final assignment for the Coursera course Mastering Software Development in R. Within this package some functions are written to clean data and some techniques are used to visualize the data. 

The data used concerns earthquake data downloaded from the [NOAA site](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&s=1&d=1). 

More information about the setup of the data cleaning and visualization can be found within the vignettes.
